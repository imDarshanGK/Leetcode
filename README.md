# Leetcode Palindrome Number
Palindrome Number

Example 1:

          Input: x = 121
          Output: true
          Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

          Input: x = -121
          Output: false
          Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

          Input: x = 10
          Output: false
          Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 4:

          Input: x = 434
          Output: true
          Explanation: 434 reads as 434 from left to right and from right to left.
          
# Leetcode Roman to integer
Leetcode Roman to integer

Example 1:

          Input: s = "III"
          Output: 3
          Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

          Input: s = "LVIII"
          Output: 58
          Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

          Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
          Output: 1994
          Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
# Two sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 Example 1:

          Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
          Output: [0,1]
          Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
          
          Example 2:
          
          Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
          Output: [1,2]
          Example 3:
          
          Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
          Output: [0,1]
